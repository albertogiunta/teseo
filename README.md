# Teseo
The Android client for the [Arianna](https://github.com/albertogiunta/arianna/) system.

## Configuration
In order for the App to be working, you need to manually insert or just scan a QRCode with the associated value of the address of the entry cell.

- **CUSTOM FOR EACH USE** IP of the first cell: 192.168.1.107
- **FIXED** URI of the first cell: :8081/uri1

The final address should look like this: *192.168.1.107***:8081/uri1**

You can create QRCodes that will work with your local network [here](http://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
